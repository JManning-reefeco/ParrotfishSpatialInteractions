# ParrotfishSpatialInteractionsGIT



This git contains GPS tracking data and behavioral observations for several parrotfishes (Scarus iseri, Scarus taeniopterus, Scarus vetula, Scarus guacamaia, Sparisoma aurofrenatum, and Sparisoma viride) from the coral reefs of Bonaire, Caribbean Netherlands. These data were collected from May-July 2021 and have been analyzed for two separate manuscripts that focus on different aspects of parrotfish spatial and behavioral ecology. 

The first manuscript uses the StaticInteractions and DynamicInteractions R Markdown files to analyze movement and behavioral data for several terminal and initial phase parrotfishes on the coral reefs of Bonaire. These data are used to investigate static and dynamic spatial interactions among parrotfishes.

  Data used: move2021, dynamic, behave2021, stlength-harem, tnames
  move2021 - contains raw GPS tracks for several terminal and initial phase parrotfishes at two study sites (Aquarius and Invisibles)
  dynamic - contains raw GPS tracks for several simultaneously tracked pairs of parrotfishes at two study sites (Aquarius and Invisibles)
  behave2021 - contains behavioral data collected from video observations of several parrotfishes in Bonaire. These data were collected concurrently with the movement data in move2021.
  stlength-harem - contains the standard lengths and harem size estimates for each individual (harem sizes are not available for initial phase fishes)
  tnames - unique territory identifiers for repeatedly tracked individuals

The second manuscript uses the DearEnemies R Markdown file to analyze additional behavioral data for a subset of the same S. viride tracked previously, as well as the movement and space use of multiple non-territorial, "floater", terminal phase S. viride. These data are used to investigate dear enemy effects in S. viride.

  Data used: dearenemy, Annotations, Labelset
  dearenemy - data from behavioral observations of several terminal phase S. viride that were tracked in the move2021 dataset
  Annotations - benthic data from photoquadrats placed along transects within S. viride territories at Aquarius and Invisibles
  Labelset - the labels for the benthic data
